Project:
1. Task Executor Library
   TaskExecutor is a service class that maintains a pool (collection) of N threads that are used to execute 
   instances of Tasks provided by the TaskExecutor’s clients. Interfaces for both the TaskExecutor and Task 
   have been provided and must be used to implement the service (including the package structure). 
   
   You have also been provided a driver application and Task implementation (TaskExecutorTest.java and SimpleTestTask.java) 
   that you can use to design, debug, and test your submissions. 

2. Data Store Client – Server Project
   This project will involve constructing a client-server system that communicates over TCP/IP sockets. 
   The server will store, retrieve, delete, & list named data sets on the server. 
   Each data set is associated with a string name provided in the client’s request to the server. 
   The server is responsible for storing this data in a persistent fashion for later retrieval.
   Data is persistently stored in files in a directory under the project directory.
